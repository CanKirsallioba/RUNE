$ This file includes meaningful example programs that are written in RUNE.

$ The user defines a function for checking the drone's battery and land it if the battery is low
void batteryCheck() {
    if (getBattery() <= 10) {
        land();
    } else {
        rotateClockwise(TRUE, 360);
    }
}

$ The drone takes off
takeoff();

$ It flies upward for 30 meters
up(30);

$ Count variable is defined and initialized to 0.
int count <- 0;

$ First, the drone's altitude is checked. If it has enough altitude, it does 5 front flips

if (readAltitude() > 20){
    while (count <= 5) {
        doFlip(TRUE);
        count <- count + 1;
    }
} else {
    up(20); 
}

$ At this point the user may want to check the battery.
batteryCheck();

$ Then the user may want to take a picture, but the altitude of the drone may be too much.
turnOnCamera(TRUE);
readAltitude();

$ The drone decreases its altitude by 10 meters.
down(10);

$ The user takes a picture.
takePictures();

$ The user may also want to check the time to remember when the photo was taken.
readTimestamp();

$ Then the user may want to move the drone forward by 10.4 meters to fly around a bit more.
forward(10.4);

$ After all the flying when the user wants to land the drone he or she rotates the drone.
rotateClockwise(TRUE, 180);
forward(10.4);

$ The user sees a pack of birds advancing towards the drone, he or she panics and calls the emergency function.
emergency(TRUE);

$ Since emergency is called and the engine is stopped, the drone crashes to the ground.
$ The user checks the drone to make sure it is still working.

takeoff();
up(5);
down(4.5);

$ After making sure that the drone is still working the user lands the drone.
land();
