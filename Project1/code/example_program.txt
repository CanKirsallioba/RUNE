$ The drone takes off
takeoff();

$ It flies upward for 30 meters
up(30);

$ Count variable is defined and initialized to 0.
int count <- 0;

$ The drone does 5 front flips.
while (count <= 5) {
    doFlip(TRUE);
    count <- count + 1;
}

$ At this point the user may want to check the battery.
getBattery();

$ Then the user may want to take a picture, but the altitude of the drone may be too much.
turnOnCamera(TRUE);
readAltitude();

$ The drone decreases its altitude by 10 meters.
down(10);

$ The user takes a picture.
takePictures();

$ The user may also want to check the time to remember when the photo was taken.
readTimestamp();

$ Then the user may want to move the drone forward by 10.4 meters to fly around a bit more.
forward(10.4);

$ After all the flying when the user wants to land the drone he or she rotates the drone.
rotateClockwise(TRUE, 180);
forward(10.4);

$ The user sees a pack of birds advancing towards the drone, he or she panics and calls the emergency function.
emergency(TRUE);

$ Since emergency is called and the engine is stopped, the drone crashes to the ground.
$ The user checks the drone to make sure it is still working.

takeoff();
up(5);
down(4.5);

$ After making sure that the drone is still working the user lands the drone.
